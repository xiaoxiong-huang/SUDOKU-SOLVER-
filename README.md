# Homework 4 for CS131
Sudoku Solver
Implemented using Backtracking algorithm.

## Usage
```bash
#   Run the program:
python3 Sudoku_Solver.py
```

## Filtering
I used forward checking to eliminate any invaild value.

## Detail
Detail about the code can be found in comment. Both simple and hard sudoku are hard coded, program will
run simple and hard one next to each other. Also, I am assuming given sudoku is vaild(i.e. grid is 
9X9 and only 1-9 is in sudoku and no law of sudoku is broken.)
